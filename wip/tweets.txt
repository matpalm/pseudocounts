Much better idea: downloading and using Acorn instead of waiting for Gimp to compile. Thanks @dsully and @johnhugg!
@johnhugg @dsully Downloading Acorn now. Thanks! I am using it to do some basic image editing (e.g., blurring out text) for my presentation.
@dsully I did talk about you and your monitoring work (and OpenTSDB) with @saintstack, by the way :-)
@dsully I haven't heard of Acorn or Pixelmator, will look at them. Should have used brew in the first place, but mistakenly went with ports.
Typed "port install gimp". Left for lunch, walked around Central Antwerp, had long lunch, walked some more. Returned and it's still running.

Microsoft released F# with an Apache 2.0 license... have they ever used that license before?  If I had told myself from 10y ago... "Never!"
Walking your ZooKeeper-ified code through the debugger is sadmaking.  But it quickly shows you new places you need to catch exceptions!
@rjurney go to the doctor and get a zpac.  It will all go away in like 3 days.  I waited a month before I figured that out. :\
@xianxu you got it!
@larsonite - that was my proof of your claim!
@precipice @nelson ah, that makes sense. so you want to add it as a service to tweetie that expects some endpt. i will tell them /cc @cynk
@nelson ah, sorry, its on the flickr iphone app. flickr can't force twitter clients to do it :)
i'm using cloudfront and have noticed from time to time that images/css/js sometimes just doesn't serve. also seen on quora & twitter. wtf?
if facebook still had the old facebook groups, there would already be a million members of the anti-TSA group. opportunity?
@thekarladam i don't think people doubt it will succeed for an area they already dominated, personal communications, people wanted more.
@nelson how does it differ from flickrs twitter integration?
@al3x @Google google's account system has gone to hell. the attempted integration of google apps for domains is likely the culprit.
@mcannonbrookes @crazybob maybe if you moan a lot while they are doing it along with a tip maybe they will stop with this nonsense.
@derek @codepo8 as another physicist I agree. Can't stand that show.
@derek you are serving an HTML page instead of a .class file somehow. probably an applet or something with a misconfigured server?
@tgautier ah, good point. Im trying to do it for my service though or stories I publish on a users behalf.
@satishd weird. I normally see the opposite. Probably heavy demand on weekends. I see 2.2MB/a most of the time.

@amicel I haven't read Snow Crash yet but I am hereby adding it on my kindle wish list :)
@atpassos_ml yes I agree your approach looks better, once at the cython level it's trivial to init your datastruct from a single csr vector.
@atpassos_ml  @mathieuen furthermore when you treat one vector at a time in python level code you have a design / perf issue anyway
@atpassos_ml you can use csr_matrix with shape (1, vector_dim). It's a bit of a cognitive overload but you can get use to it quickly
@atpassos_ml @mathieuen and then contribute sparse autoencoders to scikit-learn :)
@atpassos_ml  @mathieuen interesting: you should learn cython with http://bit.ly/bP5Sqx  and implement it, benchmark it and blog it

@jonmrich by contrast, we collect data on every url, and try to have the full history for every URL, which means polling or activity streams
@jonmrich my understanding is that they pull it it in live only when you request that data - it happens during the page request.
@jonmrich nah, great questions. we'd obviously love to get FB data for every URL - API mismatch is the problem, hence the FB app.
@jonmrich public api works if you want to poll for few dozen links, but not when you have millions. it's an integration challenge.
@jonmrich link.getStats does not give you the actual conversations, and requires polling for updates. hence our FB app.
@spastorino was in IRB fiddling with data, so no syntax highlighting either, which is what made it so hard to spot as well. fun stuff! :)
@germaninthetown ugh, made that mistake as well in the past... sigh :-)
@joeharris76 and THAT would be why some people hate frameworks ;)

@dshen which is fine, just that it's a diff model than 500 startups.  more traditional lead investor with cautious approach to funding.
@LaunchLife as lead investor, it's a reasonable strategy.  for us, we have a diff approach.  but your approach isn't exactly "lean" either.
@LaunchLife that's a shark's investor perspective, not an "invest on what's working" perspective... valid, but not my bag.
@cappaert or those of us with kids, tends to be most critical variable.
@dshen maybe but you can't raise enough cash to avoid FAIL. there is finite limit to investor cash & patience, similarly founder dilution.

@mikekarnj Great blog post. Hadn't seen that one before. Are you in NY -- want to grab coffee one day?
@MoneyToolkit Thanks for helping to clear up that confusion. Bankers tend to get confused about technology, funnily enough.
@Instapayment Actually, we're not. We partner with banks & provide a worry-free alternative to banking, with a focus on customer experience.
@rshevlin We know the site is a bit light on info, will be updating soon. Until then, any specific questions that you'd like us to answer?
@jms_ Not in the near term. Banking regulations vary widely from country to country - so we are focused on launching in the USA first.
@philhavens Ah, ok. Reg D limits people from making more than 6 withdrawals from a savings account in a month http://bit.ly/9wmTW3

@BenVitale No, because probability works with measurable sets. The Banach-Tarski paradox requires non-measurable sets.
The mean of a Beta(a, b) random variable is a/(a+b).  The mode is (a-1)/(a+b-2) provided a &gt; 1 and b &gt; 1.

@jeffsand Thanks! Writing: You gotta be in it to win it.
Nate Silver's take on the economics of new TSA scans. (With a nod to my recent piece half-defending security theater.) http://nyti.ms/9M7sV2
@delfuego whoo! I'm famous! :)
Right now @danamo is killing me with the deadpan quotes from Charlie Rose interviewing Jay-Z.
@freerobby Well, good thing I don't use WordPress, then? :)
Has anybody made an open source version of http://www.20thingsilearned.com/ in HTML5 that could be turned into a blog template?
There's no rule saying we can't thoroughly soak our crotches in lukewarm water right before going through security at the airport, right?
Interesting that libraries are largely non-profit, but adapted to digital media consumption much more efficiently than big media companies.
@timhaines you have to retweet & favorite this tweet, then look at it on new twitter, to find out! :)
Huh. @randyjackson8 on the new MJ album: "Some of the songs are him, and some aren't. I would be[t] my life on that.”
@questlove your profile pic is kind of blowing my mind. In a good way.
@ibrook terrible because of my writing? Or because you don't like the point I'm making?

@miconian EVEN MORE ADVICE.
Here's what you'd get if you asked me for advice about your startup or project: http://2.dashes.com/a41SBr
@mattcutts have you (or Google) responded to http://www.benedelman.org/hardcoding/ anywhere publicly?
@prebynski Go to any page on Wikipedia; The fundraising appeal from Jimmy Wales has now been changed to a bright red color.
@sogrady No, I say that the current system tries to address perceptions of non-savvy travelers, in addition to legitimate security issues.
@Jason not sure it was a case of "high on your own supply" so much as not having picked a single goal to focus on.
@caro Worth noting @FCC is also learning from startup culture: http://www.fastcompany.com/1701195/fcc-hosts-first-ever-open-developer-day
@sogrady to be fair, I'm articulating a point of view. If you read what I wrote, it's clear I'm not personally in favor of invasive tech.
"There was a lot of excitement." - @ftrain
@jessamyn Yeah, I was struck by that as well. The whole back-and-forth is fascinating.
@davidcollantes I was a little mystified myself. 20% time run amok?
Interesting response to Gizmodo! RT @TSABlogTeam: #TSA has not, will not & our AIT cannot store images of passengers. http://ow.ly/3biJi
Only Google launches a fashion site with a registration process that tells you "This field is tied to the user's URL and cannot be changed".

@ginatrapani "app-ortunities"? SEE ME IN MY OFFICE.
I think @Jason & @Arrington should commit to giving $1 to fund a startup for every dollar they spend on lawyers suing each other.
@mathewi The striking thing to me is what a bad writer, proofreader & communicator she is. Isn't it sort of odd?
@toddbert I am below all of that! :)
@toddbert I think you're projecting. But to be fair, the Beatles *are* old, aren't they? Is there a dispute about that?
@toddbert Not sure why the vituperation, I haven't criticized anybody or anything. Just thinking out loud, like anybody else.
@toddbert Nah, I listen to lots of oldies. I just realize they're from the past.
@peterrojas The device trumped the content (&  artists) a while ago: http://dashes.com/anil/2009/06/supporting-our-artists.html
@peterrojas Michael Jackson would be worth *more* attention.
Justin Bieber's mom was born 6 years after the Beatles broke up. I like not being hung up on the past.
Hey @LinkedIn, free marketing idea: An amnesty day where everyone can update their profiles without signifying they're about to change jobs.
@adrianholovaty Hah! No, nothing against them, but they're ubiquitous enough it seems redundant to buy their albums.
Never owned a Beatles record. Doubt I'm gonna start tomorrow.
@cdixon We'll have drinks. I'll tell you about this: http://2.dashes.com/aDYA8L AND THEN WE SHALL SEE.
Really nice writeup by @waxpancake about his first week at @expertlabs: http://bit.ly/9Egt93 Our team rules. :)
@Rafe because they don't understand either?
@cdixon Nope, probably means you're both. More entrepreneurs should probably be politicians, anyway.
I hope the big iTunes announcement tomorrow is that IT CAN READ EMAIL!
@sacca @crystale Congrats!
@Medley it's not a troll, it's a sincere position I don't hear articulated within my own echo chamber.
@Medley Absolutely agree part of TSA's mandate should be education about actual threats. Leadership is hard.

@djacobs no, a five-point torx is rare. Torx in general is common, but these aren't.
The Commodore 64 is the best computer I've ever owned.
@sudama I like when they use it in a forum signature, like it's listing your casemod hardware or customizations on your hot rod.
@jennydeluxe OMG you are the new Shari Lind!
@djacobs you know perl, you can't possibly not know stone soup.
@Padmasree well, to tell the truth, I made detailed plans to have vague plans today. :)
@kevinmarks I don't suppose they are. But part of my annoyance is that they're so full of bad advice, too.
@steveivy sure, privacy is fine, but overly cute is inexcusable. :)
@kevinmarks no, I'm fine with pseudonymous conventions for privacy, but cutesy "DD" stuff is sort of insipid.
Pretty much any website where people refer to family members as "DH" or "DW" or have abbreviations for their kids makes me hate the world.

@interfluidity and it's a persistent paradox (to me) that they get paid 1% AUM for such a small alleged active performance.

@interfluidity @abnormalreturns sure. For starters, most managers constrain active returns, and that's a proven cause of inefficiency.

you cannot post photos from your phone's photo album, nor to other services like Flickr or Facebook, on Path http://rww.to/dseVUW
there is no way to leave a comment on, or "like," or interact with other than view, a photo on Path http://rww.to/dseVUW
judging from its home page, Path is a site for sharing blurry drunken pics of convos w/ brunette ladies...w/ your closest 50 friends ;)
@mko I'm sorry - I meant analysis performed by **anyone else** fair point though
Curious about Path?  you should read @rww's coverage, it's the best from a user's perspective. http://rww.to/dseVUW
@om i blame big mainstream media incumbents etc. they cry like babies if they don't get the advantage every time
@Megan who was the PR company behind the well-run, high profile announcement? the same PR company that was tipping techmeme, of course ;)

@johnmyleswhite Here is a barely-longer-than-a-tweet post on social complexity: http://bit.ly/aD7zId
What is Social Complexity? http://post.ly/x12l
@johnmyleswhite That deserves a quick post, I'll put something up this evening.
@johnmyleswhite Other examples: game theory, decision theory, and multi-agent systems; applied to social behavior
@johnmyleswhite Somewhat, via complexity theory.  It's the study of group behaviors (e.g., organization) from the pov of complexity theory.
@johnmuleswhite re: IIA, are you into social complexity research?
@gwhalin "I still owe money, to the money, to the money I owe."

@peterflom such a good feeling.
Anyone (ab)using #hadoop or #cascading for processing large binary fields or generating side effect files for external processes?
@DataJunkie that does sound like a good definition of a bad school.  =)
@johnmyleswhite and not enough tenure track positions. I can see brand mattering here since connections are important to being selected.
@johnmyleswhite that would be awesome if you publish that.  I've noticed similar top-tier heavy faculty in nearly all schools. Lots of PhDs.
@DataJunkie I agree. But what makes a school bad? Is a state school with a lower rank bad, or just lower-ranked? Just pondering out loud...
What do you think about university brands/rankings? Do smart, productive ppl only come from top-tier schools? Go Stanford or don't bother?

@japerk does that apply to people that you're not following so they can't DM you? ;)
if you're loading tweets into MongoDB, how are you handling the date field? Are you preprocessing, or converting to a date inside of Mongo?
@imjameshall got it.  I'm using MongoDB as a document store to perform some twitter analysis. I'm a died-in-the-wool SQL fan.
@imjameshall curious-why? I'm starting to sip some of the MongoDB kool-aid, it's working nicely for my application.
@mattquandt  @RockMelt No thanks...with my workload, if i try ANYTHING new, my head will explode.

I'm doing some research for a blog post, please tell me whether or not you actively use the favorites feature of twitter, and if so, why.
@johnmyleswhite @HarlanH and of course, thanks to @drewconway (pictured) for leading me to zoom.it
@johnmyleswhite @HarlanH Here's a viz of who's tweets I've favorited. Code and blog post coming soon. http://zoom.it/TCRQ
@NICKSN @kode80 i'm listening to it so freaking loudly, the bass is kicking me in the chest
@HarlanH so it makes sense for me to favorite and then try and keep up with the reading.  http://bit.ly/cnVMLv  notice i said try.
@HarlanH i would imagine its very very small.  Figure I get most of my reading list from what my twitter friends link to.....
@kode80 track #11 ftw
@goldieonice its like the old college FB saying: The most popular man on campus always seems to be the backup QB.
@DecisionStats @mat_kelcey We'll have to let Mat answer that. I'm a MongoDB newbie myself but am now in love with it.

@DataJunkie that's what I'm afraid of.I'm still learning and trying to define sizing and retention/archiving requirements.
@johnmyleswhite do you still want the tweets? Ive temporarily stopped collecting due to network issues but still have over 700M since June
@justingough south florida endurance crossfit http://bit.ly/cqykVX recommended by @MSURabbot
@Alex__Lawrence when i'm riding my bike up drawbridges instead of emigration or mueller park, i'll gladly switch ;)
@brianbreslin @semanticvoid i wrote a program that calls the favorites method with and without a userid, it just returned MY favorites.
@Alex__Lawrence oh how I miss living bountiful at times. Then again south Florida is pretty nice, too.
@semanticvoid and frankly i dont feel like building a test app just yet, i'm trying to do 3 other things, of course =P
@semanticvoid will that let me know WHO favorited one of MY tweets? their curl console is acting up now.
@semanticvoid doesn't that return your own favorites?
@drewconway @siah it drives me nuts because I see that Twitter.com itself uses it, as well as tweetdeck, haven't see it in the API docs.
@siah i know and it bugs me.  i re-read the api docs and couldn't see it.  i wonder if it might be undocumented.  i havent checked the lists
@HarlanH oh i ALWAYS favorite tweets from my mobile device, especially when interesting urls are presented.  http://bit.ly/cgSPTZ
using twitter favorites as a to-read list http://post.ly/1CNGP
Will twitter ever release an API call that tells who/when one of your own tweets are favorited?I have an app waiting in the wings for this.

I pulled out a ring, asked @crystale to spend the rest of her life with me, and she said "of course!" http://instagr.am/p/QyYT/
And in that special place, tucked away on a sidestreet in Cholon, I ordered a bottle of Vietnamese champagne, and reached in my pocket.
Then tonight, I took her as a surprise to the banquet hall where her mom and dad were married under the weight of the war in Vietnam.
And so, today I brought her to the place where she was born 35 years ago, and to the temple where her dad prayed for her as a newborn.
... when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours, we join up with them and fall in mutual weirdness and call it love."
Our days since have been replete with laughter, exploration, and weirdness. "We are all a little weird and life's a little weird, and...
Finally, fifteen years after I first laid eyes on her, she asked me, "Why haven't you and I ever dated?" Fifteen years! Carpe diem.
Each time she would lovingly turn me down and get back to planning an adventure for us. Invariably we would end up laughing our asses off.
Though my heart sank, we became exactly that. Great, lasting friends. Though, I asked her out a few times along the way for good measure.
During the first week of our freshman year, I saw her and *immediately* asked her out. She laughed and said "We should just be friends."
@nicholasmarx Good point. But, I'm convinced he and HCM are one in the same.

@swardley Yea. Mebbe. I think my analog systems professor would cry "feedback system" here. But difficult to know with ill-defined terms.
@swardley But my perception is 1) the internets came along and reduced barriers, then 2) media got commoditized.
@swardley Hmm, I think we're arguing in a factless vacuum ill-suited to 140 chars. :)
@swardley No, exactly as I said. See your media example. It was commoditized due to reduced barriers to entry, not the other way around.
@swardley Reduced barriers of entry causes commoditization. :)

Opening the second bottle of my precious Portoguese wine, a virtual "cin cin" with @adegga @f and @pedromelo :)
I like a lot photos made by Pedro Moura Pinheiro http://pedromourapinheiro.com/ I meet this guy at codebits and it's a cool guy also.
@timhaines nothing I'm aware of... Maybe some return value changed in edge cases, but it's a semantical thing, and new ret vals are saner
@pedromelo absolutely :) The mindstorm is really awesome toy, even if the UI is too limited. A simple language integrated would be cool
@timhaines the tag 2.2-alpha&lt;X&gt; where X is greater :) And currently this is the same as the current HEAD in master branch
Playing with lego mindstorm with my son but the UI programming sucks, better to switch to nbc, but... it is wrirtten IN PASCAL?!
@tobi btw I think you'll like this 2.2 feature: https://github.com/antirez/redis/blob/master/redis.conf#L282

@niccai many people run their sites in this mode, it's ok, just make sure to know how to configure it well reading some doc first

Inception for Berlusconi, very hilarious video (but in Italian language) http://youtu.be/PxTF9Vu78lo
@freshtonic but not instant sync without any action in the other systems
having dotfiles synchronized via dotbox and trivial symlinks to .vimrc, .oh-my-zsh and so forth is a very cool multi-computer setup
@masonoise everything will work well in the mac book air but VMware fusion IMHO... I think this CPU is not enough for virtualization
@masonoise but well all in all, the bottle neck is the CPU for this thing to be really a fast user experience. Especially for compiling
@masonoise for the use case of this small thing 4GB are not the limit, and the SSD neither as it's fast. The CPU is not super fast but ok :)
@anibalrojas not getting this but seems like that dropbox does not carry executable attribute and alike...
@oscar_raig the overlap is small, the two systems are mostly used for different use cases
@dima767 @flangy yep probably most of the time is due to the fact it depends on boost, but you can compile it form the tar.gz without it
@flangy ok :) but actually it at the end works well, that's a good point. Thanks for brew a tons
@ahzf Ive no doubt ;) actually it is near to be the most common open source development hardware at all...
@zrail yep 13" can be definitely, 11" is fine for working a few hours, but I don't think it's going to be a great primary box :)
redis development environment completely replicated in the macbook air 11" in just 1050 grams of weight. time to code :)
@zrail I use MBP 13" as primary machine ;) So I think the 13" can be actually... but as I got it for using around I picked the smallest
let's try how the Redis git repository and @dropbox are going to play together...
Sorry the wine service is adegga.com (@adegga) not addega ;) wrong spelling. Btw there is also a free API to access the content
Thanks to @addega not just for the wine but also for the great service. This guys invented something like ISBN for wine, very cool.
@evilhackerdude the speed is quite ok, and for portability the size is not critical for me that use as a standard day-to-day box a 13" MBP!
configuring my new macbook air 11"... at codebit it was not fun to go around with 5k of just laptops, 3k my girlfriend + 2k mine
@davidnwelton for company emails I use a resident client and since I started I was shocked about *how fast* it is... especially searching

If @jzawodn is running 2.1.7 (c086b8) in production at Craigslist I guess it's time to tag it as 2.2-alpha5, and indeed, just tagged
Before replying to this post never realized how easy it was to implement "cache groups" with Redis: http://bit.ly/9jFU3d
@lolli42 great! 2.2 is a much better caching best than 2.0 btw
I'm starting to have the second layer of Redis Cluster (that is, the details) every day more clear... that's a very good thing :)
and if you feel in your heart you are a "poor man" hacker, in your essence, make sure to read this: http://poormansprofiler.org/
Hero of the day: gdb -p `pidof redis-server` -ex 'bt' -batch ... saved my day in an IRC debugging session (no Redis fault fortunately)
@eneko ok, it's 7 pm here so today I don't have enough time as I'm in an IRC bug tracking session already, but tomorrow I'll ping you. Thx!
@eneko sure, what redis version?
FreeBSD hacker looking for some hard core bug tracking session? Here there is some interesting challenge: http://bit.ly/atb69r
well may work just commenting the setopt line but what I actually did was to replace 'setops' with 'unsetopt'
problem with zsh history solved, FYI: in oh-my-zsh there are two duplicated entries of share_history. one in caps. Just comment both
ideas about why commenting 'setopt shared_history' in ~/.oh-my-zsh/lib/history.zsh does not lead to the desired effect? thx
@pedromelo @f thank you for all guys :) I really enjoyed my time with you and your friends. Ah and all the wine reached Sicily safe! ;)
Major outrage at @github and everybody saying good things about it? Proof that doing a lot of things well makes rare problems ok. deserved.
@_km yes that's one of the best places for sure :)
maybe it's the other way around as well as people from north may feel the coffee made in the south as too burned or alike
There is this general idea of "italian coffee", but for instance when I'm at north Italy I refuse to order a coffee at all most of the times
@PauloGaspar7 being into gastronomic tourism is a great idea I think ;) Btw coffee varies a lot between parts of Italy itself!
@jonasl glad to know everything is working fine! It's one of the best moments in the development cycle i guess ;)
finally at home, long trip but everything fine... codebit was an awesome experience and I meet a number of great guys. See you soon! thx
@roidrage I think the latter as ways less deterministic
Still in Rome but leaving for Sicily in minutes... I'll miss Lisbon but wine I'm carry with me will alleviate sadness I bet!
Leaved the Hotel, will be traveling for the whole day to reach home but it was definitely worth it
yes not only valgrind now runs on snow leopard but finally it's possible to suppress the possibly lost warnings
@PauloGaspar7 absolutely! :) So far the first that's ok in EU if you go in random places. Of course in the right places is good everywhere
It looks like I found something solving the key iterator and the cluster get-key-in-hashslot at once. But this means no key iterator in 2.2
@derekcollison really awesome slides!
resistance is futile, #codebits2010 is the coolest conference ever...
@jzawodn that was fast, awesome :) Thanks
@miksago just little bits of design that will end in the final one ;)
Issue 374 fixed in Redis master. Thanks to @jzawodn for reporting and tracing the problem. Commit: http://bit.ly/cSwpZy
just found a sit at the bar kitchen corner here at codebits, briefly looking at the new replication but of redis master for a quick fix
@jzawodn sorry for not being more responsive on the issue, reason is I'm at Codebits right now but will fix it Monday morning. Thx
I definitely got a few good ideas for Redis Cluster from @pedromelo thanks!
@jzawodn today I fixed a critical bug if you are using maxmemory! :)
#codebits2010 http://yfrog.com/fyzklj
@jweiss @roidrage great, see you there :)
Watched a good Redis talk by @f the first time I'm in the public :)
@janl yep but only if done in the wrong way I hope. I'll try to be there to say how multiple models is the way to go and that I like SQL
@roidrage it is a shame you are not here at codebits to the NoSQL vs SQL panel :)
Just met @pedromelo at #codebits2010, as expected he is cool and friendly, but it's always very nice to meet face 2 face
@pedromelo can't find you :) The table disposition in the picture does not perfectly matches the hacked reality I guess ;)
oh-my-zsh is super cool, thank you @nvie
@pedromelo haha ok cool :)
@MrJaba I use zsh so I guess I've to modify it a bit but it's a good start I guess :)
I guess it's time I put the git branch in my prompt. I type 'git b' an endless number of times every day
#codebits 2010 is like the wonderland of hackers... super cool to be here
@maniksurtani no idea but hope so... :)
Today at Codebit at 18:00 there is a NoSQL vs SQL panel in the main strage, if you are interested let's meet there ;)
@pedromelo it's a shame the NoSQL/SQL table is at the same time of your Git talk, I wanted to attend your talk! Well at least let's meet :)

Met another teen who deletes all wall posts. Deletes status updates 12-24 hrs after posting. Deletes comments immediately after reading.

Huh - the Boston Logan Wifi page is using Moderizr and the video tag. Nice to see HTML 5 popping up in the wild.
Unfortunately a faulty XMLHttpRequest is pretty much impossible to feature detect. Doing extra server requests is unreasonable overhead.
Opera, by far, has the worst XMLHttpRequest implementation. So many inconsistencies - many can't be worked around or feature detected.
There doesn't appear to be a way to detect a 304 response from an Ajax request in Opera: http://gist.github.com/599419

@sampullara short answer: Percona, longer answer:  you mean node level ACID? cause otherwise isn't really core offering (cc @joestump)
@al3xandru we're rolling 'em out at Etsy now with a few tweaks.  Though like @rk mentioned we still don't make strong k-sort claims.
"Benchmarks are nice, but functionality matters too." - @rk

Thanks to @alexandrak we've got tickets for @dresdendolls Sunday!  Saw 'em 5 yrs ago on Halloween. (thanks also @salaud and @LauraVogel)
@alexandrak  @LauraVogel we were just introduced by @salaud minutes ago.
@LauraVogel you're amazing, but I found something (thnxs @salaud!)
@alexandrak ha! that'd be awesome.  we haven't seen them since Halloween,  2005, in Boston.
@alexandrak two (tho 1 would help)
Anyone have a lead on Dresden Dolls tickets for this Sunday?  Totally sold out, and my initial searches aren't turning up much (reasonable).

@carinmeier that sounds like a reasonable trade-off. ;)
@ecspike oddly, nope. but I will look it up now!
@codetojoy you ARE creating art.  And I don't mean that flippantly.

@hokiecsgrad So modest... It was great working with you Ryan!
@wesbaker Thanks man: how is Shannon? Surviving the 'burg?

@spyced Thanks man... looking forward to continued collaboration. Let's talk sstables in the next 2 weeks, pretty please?
@janl I must have had an LSD flashback to our time at #sxsw: we're not competing, are we?
Also doing a wonderful job guiding @Rackspace Cloud on the business side is @pamatthe: thanks again for all of your support and mentoring.

@wattsteve I'll be moving to the bay area... I've loved Austin, so it's quite a bittersweet departure.

@ArmyOfBruce re: Scala on LLVM: are you referring to github.com/greedy/scala , or is there a more active effort?
@ryanobjc Sure thing!
@ryanobjc Most clients are thin, and connect to a random node, from which the routing happens. Thick clients connect directly to a replica.
@ryanobjc Ick... not "masters": routing has replica preferences for keys: bit.ly/aG7u84 . Can also route around slow nodes: bit.ly/9qWCsa
@ryanobjc Cassandra's read-repair fraction is tunable: read-heavy workloads should tune lower: for 0.1, mem-usage of N=3, R=1 is 1.2 times.

@gruber In principle yeah, but there are a *lot* of shops out there working on native apps just now.

@siah @JohnDCook There's no *universally acceptable* stats library for Python. I've found NumPy to be too black box for it.
@gappy3000 Yes the models and concepts are totally useful. Writing proofs about some toy variation of a method that nobody uses is not.
@nealrichter Maximum likelihood, OLS etc. is important. All that stuff from pure Mathematics though has little practical use.
@nealrichter Mathematical Statistics as in convergence in distribution etc.? Then yes.

@broadbandgeek My 10 yr old FVS318 was dropping connections. I didn't give WRN3500L's stock firmware a chance. Loaded DD-WRT immediately.
New router (Netgear WNR3500L with DD-WRT) working great. AIM doesn't disconnect every 5 mins, and I don't get disconnected from work server.

@ganeumann yep, hence i wish i had my advice when i was younger
@ganeumann i am over 30 and would probably agree :)
@yoniboy btw, if anything i'm trying to argue *against* collecting brands through your career, not for it...
@yoniboy a brand does help as a filter, but i have plenty of investments for example in people with no college degree etc.
@sergekass true - i wish i had had my own advice when i was younger :)
@portman_wills ivy league college, google, goldman sachs, mckinsey, etc.
Optimal number of "fancy" brands on your resume is 1. 1 means you can join club if you want, more than one means you actually like the club.
@j2labs fair point.  i'm not saying brands don't matter, but once you have 1 or 2 under your belt it's time to stop collecting them.
Huge hurdle for many people joining or founding startups is their confidence is closely tied to big brands - famous college, company etc.
@DaveedGR @cchiego but no single definition will satisfy everyone
@DaveedGR @cchiego indeed, though one could argue that in the KKK's case the terrorism was most acute in the face of desegregation
@cchiego @DaveedGR my argument is that traditional criminality does not destabilize institutions, nor is it intended to
@DaveedGR @cchiego perhaps terrorism is best defined as acts intended to destabilize civilian institutions (formal or informal)?
@DaveedGR @cchiego but if terrorism is def'n by political coercion, than how can Shabaab be terrorists if there is no state to coerce?
@DaveedGR @cchiego but if terrorism is def'n by political coercion, than how can Shabaab be acting as terrorism if there is no
@cchiego @DaveedGR Interesting point, as there is an implicit assumption of state capacity for terrorism to be def'n as political coercion
@DaveedGR correct, that is a more accurate way to put it
@joshuafoust I always found that advice to be useful when I lived in DC
@DaveedGR I find a majority of so-called terrorism cases more rightfully classifieds as traditional law enforcement incidents
@DaveedGR I find the "political motivation" definition of terrorism useful as well.

@ivanassen @groby I like bars.
@Tim_jarratt The key is that you should be capable of digging into the abstraction when necessary.
@rberger To the point at which it affects your use of the abstraction. e.g. to use Cascalog effectively, you need to understand M/R
@nealrichter Hmm. I guess I meant more with systems stuff. Like having a general understanding of query planning when using SQL
.@andreisavu You don't have to understand everything. e.g. knowing generally how the OS does paging and caching
Too many programmers think an abstraction gives them the license to not understand what's going on under the covers. It doesn't.
@DataJunkie ok, that didn't work ;-) ML theory IMO is useful s.t. people don't walk around viewing ML as just an oddball collection of algs

@prokopp I will probably blog about my practical findings soon... I keep repeating this to myself and never do it but this time I will! :P
Ok I hereby declare this geekend complete: a weird mix of state of the art linear algebra, drum&bass and tech-induced diplomatic disruption
@atpassos_ml you know what? the iterated power method actually improves the randomized SVD on noisy data: http://bit.ly/fsIb1O
@prokopp I am currently investigation this issue: singular vectors are no longer exact but still useful for face recognition for instance
I really enjoy doing #reproducibleresearch by working on the Gunnar Martinsson SVD method in @scikit_learn with tests and benchmarks
Gaining a lot of scalable linear algebra insight thanks to this truly excellent NIPS 2009 tutorial http://bit.ly/dS2eRL by P.G. Martinsson

My answer at @statsqa on Randomized SVD and singular values - with benchmarks!: http://bit.ly/hQR99s
@atpassos_ml great I hope that @gramfort can review / merge it as I am now away from my dev box
@atpassos_ml it's to be expected:  the sign of a vector in a basis is not important. There is not best sign for singular vectors.
@atpassos_ml actually here is the test file I forgot to checkin last time: http://bit.ly/g9hmmX
@atpassos_ml I have added test_svd.py in my last checkin. Please feel free to add a benchmarks/bench_svd.py file in the toplevel folder.
@atpassos_ml It's amazing that researchers are still making huge progress on "simple" and fundamental linear algebra problems such as SVD
@atpassos_ml interesting keep us posted. Is the power iteration method implemented in the gensim project?
@atpassos_ml I found a bug (lack of truncation) in your impl of approximate SVD in scikit-learn: http://bit.ly/dH4L8V - much faster now :)
@jpratchard sorry, I don't know any such book. You should ask on the scipy users mailing list and / or on http://metaoptimize.com/qa
Lasso LARS vs coordinate descent benchmarks @statsqa with latest @scikit_learn http://bit.ly/eZgUCH
@luispedrocoelho I got the idea while waiting for an NNMF to converge so I googled it and found this preprint. Might give it a try this WE.
@luispedrocoelho @gramfort has one you tried SVD initialized NNMF? http://bit.ly/hMs7gl

@ogrisel it's quickly becoming the defacto machine learning python lib! i use it for spittballing ideas. Thanx for the HARD work :)
@kendall it'll take a couple of days for data to hit major shares. Sites practically dead.
@kendall "freedom of information" releases & even leaks need to have a "redeeming" quality & if they do i support. Can't find 1 in this dump
@kendall and everyone in the diplomatic core knows this happens the problem is now it's in writing to present as fact to radicals, etc. :(
@kendall biggest issue w/ pentagon drop was lack of responcible redaction. These throw red meat to the wrong people making everything harder
I'm generally a big fan of public release of as much information as possible but at this time the latest WikiLeaks release is irresponcible.
@kendall me! ;)
@Scobleizer I think Twitter & Facebook, etc pose a greater issue for Yelp and like companies.

Whatever the question, Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP) is the answer!
@westling Go sooners :)
@PhilBeaudoin there was no easier way to protest than trashing his many years of education? :)

@jeffreyhorner thanks for working on it. It would be great if people could contribute some Ajax examples.
@jeffreyhorner @HarlanH No, as I said rApache is a great project, I compiled it in the summer though and haven't used the Ubuntu pack yet.

@iamreddave @fbahr it is called " Gharz-al-hasaneh" kiva type loans that have prize bonds instead of fixed interests
@iamreddave These are typically documented under Islamic banking, can you see this google book p34? http://bit.ly/emDd0M cc @fbahr
@fbahr I don't really know about Shah's regime, I was referring to the current stupid regime actually :)
@fbahr there are saving accounts in Iran that give prizes instead to interests, prizes like cars,houses, tickets, & cash prizes @iamreddave
@iamreddave thnks, very interesting! ironically, the idea has been practiced in Iran for 40 years because interests are against Islam
@redandexpert watch your language chino! there are kids around.
@HarlanH so I guess it is on the same boat as rApache, rApache is a good product but hard to compile and configure

Trivia: Who played nontrivial roles in both Animal House (movie) and #Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV)? #BTVS #trivia
@Thedodgeretort One was an only child, the other the youngest kid, so all their respective immediate families were German-born as well.
@Thedodgeretort Both my parents were German. http://www.softwarememories.com/2010/10/29/a-bad-week-in-the-monash-family/
Many thanks, @datachick et al. Fortunately, Thanksgiving meant nothing to us, so the holidays won't really matter until next month.
I always had a small family. Now it's down to zero, with the huge exception of @lindabarlow and whoever else I have through her.
Most blog Twitter widgets I see have old-style - i.e. broken - URLs for @replies. Going to tweet isn't workaround; #newtwitter has same bug.
Googling on German nonsense verses I learned from my family. Found some of the key ones, e.g. "Am Honig leckt der Bär der Braune ..."
@dmenninger Appropriate that you said "few" rather than giving a hard number. Good luck w/ that ...
@NeilRaden @jameskobielus Unless you're exactly in the target market for an app that happens to exist and suit you well.
@NeilRaden @jameskobielus Right. SAS & competitors aside, app existence is too minor to consider in platform/tool evaluation.
@jameskobielus Or by you only mentioning vendors who had strong claims to integrating advanced analytics into DBMS.
@jameskobielus Not at all. But perhaps I was misled by you giving "analytic" top billing as part of the product name.
@jameskobielus And NZ doesn't yet have analytic infrastructure like integrated workload management, etc.
@jameskobielus Minor exceptions aside, they don't use NZ's linear algebra, stats library, or MapReduce capabilities.
@DecisionStats Good move pulling that other tweet. It was pretty obnoxious.
@jameskobielus Little of that is related to NZ's analytic stack per se. Separate kinds of NZ goodness.
.@jameskobielus Packaged analytic "solutions" are usually pretty lame. The list of exceptions is fairly short.
@jameskobielus Aster's market basket analysis or whatever is a little more app-like than anything NZ offers in the main analytic stack.
@jameskobielus If important prepackaged apps were part of the criteria, why did you include NZ?

@SethGrimes Probably my most productive work is quick-hit email consulting (by rule, all vendor clients are in retainer-style relationships)
@NeilRaden I got the impression Stuart was a private investor now, actively but not operationally involved in certain of his investments.
@jameskobielus Your top integrated analytics/DBMS choices didn't include Aster. That can only be justified via some technicality or other.
@jameskobielus W/ earlier delivery it would indeed have been leapfrog. Your January link about $20K was indeed correct back then.
@jameskobielus Microsoft was joining the recently well-established $10-15K range. $20K/TB list is old news.
@jameskobielus Did you really tell @jaivijayan $20K/TB was still the prevailing price point? And if so, why? :) NZ, EMC say Hi.
@jameskobielus Either you're not a big fan of Aster Data, or else you think the appliance/packaged software distinction is Really Important.
http://goo.gl/uFNj3 http://bit.ly/cAv0Gy @dmenningervr thinks Pentaho's Hadoop integration is a bigger deal than I do.

@irkdesu but do read again what I wrote... I'm not sure the implication is there that you're suggesting.
@irkdesu sorry to seem that way. I just have equal disdain for theatrics from the TSA & from suddenly-zealous liberty advocates.
@webinista @misterjt just depends how much they're charging for the pork rinds.
@irkdesu (Also, thanks for your efforts.)
@irkdesu Wait, me pointing out that there are injustices makes you not want to fight them? I'm confused.
@tj I didn't say anything about you; I don't know you. Fascinating that you were so defensive, though.
It's simple; We always beta-test civil liberty infringements on minority communities, until the majority gets used to them as well.
@webinista haven't seen any popular mentions or media linking the two trends. Am I missing it?
@irkdesu because they seem shocked and astonished and outraged that it's new, instead of understanding that it's been every day for decades.
It's clear that many upset at the TSA never considered that most men of color endure unjustified pat-downs just for walking down the street.

@dvirsky hehe no for me just terminal + vim + make ;) Very comfortable setup but this are tastes indeed
btw pretty odd that with a new digital monitor there is just the VGA cable included. Had to purchase one separately to fully exploit it.
@dvirsky yep unfortunately I arrived at the shop very late and the magazine was closed, so I had to pick the 22 or return again. -&gt; 22 :)
got a 22" monitor for the first time in my life. Actually an improvement compared to the 13" display especially for two terminals at once
@davidnwelton absolutely! You have to resist till Aug 2011, but it's simpler to resist in summertime ;)
@demisbellot yep married august 2011 :) The goal is making N children!
@f yep :) one of the things I could like to write is a "closed" p2p network, just for friends, something like up to 100 trusted guys.
@_km apart from redis-iter matter, I think C code when well written tends to be very reliable because of the static checks
@Seivanheidari redis cluster command line utility
No external dependencies. System software in C feels more reliable. Redis-cli already has history and line editing, we'll just extend it.
decision taken, with the help of the community on IRC. Redis-trib will be written in C as well. Reasons in the next tweet.
@demisbellot good points. Maybe after all we'll see it works well in Ruby and can avoid porting it. There are much more Ruby hackers than C
A possible plan could be starting the prototype in Ruby and turning it into C code after it is working well actually.
My main concern is that the C version would build together with Redis in a zero-dependencies environment...
Here I need some honest feedback. What do you think about implementing redis-trib in Ruby instead of C? It does not need to be fast.
@railshoster very glad you are happy with Redis. Please send me tweets if something is not working properly
plan of the afternoon, cluster auto-discovery processing the gossip session, to minimize the number of CLUSTER MEET commands needed.
survived another dentist session... not bad. Next one in a few days but prevention is much better than pain.
@sloser looks great :) Thanks
@dscape no plan to support full text search so far for Redis Cluster, you can build it by hand if you wish. We try exporting primitives
I think I was not clear about french tweets. "Redis" is a french word meaning "to say again" (similar to italian "Ridire").
I need a way to read the "Redis" search twitter stream but filtering the messages in french language... I guess I'll have to write a script
@sloser did you tried redis-tools?
@riffraff what part of regexps is not ugly? ;) as far as it works well it's very clean hehe
good cluster progresses in the morning, now trying to learn cachegrind to understand were we can gain cycles before of cache misses
@jdrowell thanks for the hint
spawning N nodes in different ports and reconnecting them at every recompilation of redis-cluster is time consuming, I need more automation
@riffraff something along the lines .{n,} ?
current solution: we clear the ip/port field from the node info, and wait for a gossip that will tell use the new address to reconnect.
current status: trying to figure what to do when after a node-&gt;node reconnection we discover it is no longer the same guy!
@mikeloukides in some place inside :) To avoid customers thinking there is an info point hehe
I love the new valgrind option: --show-possibly-lost=no if you remember I tweeted about how painful was to work without it many times
@Seivanheidari the book will take longer than this ;) Not sure about the release date currently, but we are writing.

@seppo0010 not sure yet... still to define
@tshanky thank you :)
@aschmitz I think we'll add a "last time" chapter about it if we have already an alpha version.
@tshanky still not sure... it is not impossible to have it publicly available, but I've no details / not sure yet about this
@tshanky there are really no rules and indeed bigger books have their space for sure. We just are trying to put the maximum amount of signal
@tshanky we think that 275 pages is more or less the maximum detail level every language / DB book should reach :) it's an auto-limit
@derekcollison I wish you a good flight :)
@debasishg yes makes sense, for sure the whole book will be full of advices about what is not sensible to do with it
@tshanky well it tries to cover everything more or less, but not using too much space. The title is still uncertain
@ivanristic it's in asciidoc
@roidrage lol :)
this is how the Redis book will likely be divided. 10 chapters, different sizes: https://gist.github.com/710379 we already started writing.
@tshanky hello, I @tnm8 and @pnoordhis are writing a redis book for @oreillymedia sure I'll review the redis sections of your book!
@Keltounet you are welcome
we have percentages for every chapter of the redis book and an estimated length of 275 pages.
trying to be a good OSS citizen myself filing a bug for /dev/null seek on FreeBSD: http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=152485
@riffraff haha thanks you ;)
Anyway, a big thank you for *any* bug reporting. Even if it turns out not being a bug you did a great service to Redis and its community.
Seems like a possible replication bug was not a bug actually. Cool to see that most of the times reports are false alarms ;)
good IRC brainstorming session with Pieter, time to focus on coding, cooking for my son, and then coding again.
@pnoordhuis merged on master (bsd vm), some trouble about 2.0.0, maybe we can make a branch for FreeBSD users, seems too large for master
from time to time (like now) operating on github repositories works but with an ssh-alike delay at every connection
almost finished reviewing the new @pnoordhuis VM patch that makes it FreeBSD friendly and faster on Linux... will merge today
warning... the FreeBSD lameness produced some good effect in the Redis code base thanks to @pnoordhuis so far so good :)
if you fopen() /dev/null on FreeBSD and writes, the file offset reported is always modulo 4096. How lame is that?! Breaks Redis VM.

@fishcorn Yes wrong. Who ever thought C/C++ programming made any sense?
@fishcorn Wrong, at least with an Intel processor and GNU GCC 4.2.1.
@andymurd @denislemire @stanigator For x an unsigned 32-bit integer, I get x&lt;&lt;32==x==x&gt;&gt;32.
@stanigator But I have the answer! x&gt;&gt;32 is x. But I am now angry with C++.
@andymurd My version of GCC gives me x&gt;&gt;32 = x.

@mrgunn A lot of my work was understanding the impact of mutations on the photophysics.  So you had some control there.
@philipj I've been out of the field for a while, so not current with the literature.  Found fundamental photophysics a lot more interesting
@philipj Indeed, but not written by lasers.  That looks so much cooler even if it is a million times less efficient :)

@rasmus my guess is that @pjdonnelly would also want to know what warning you were seeing. seems odd that those are messed up as well.
@rasmus hmmm. indeed. which community table reference URL are you using? The store:// one? you could make your own vetted list.
@rasmus it still has to load them to see whether you have overwritten one of the native tables. i'd advise not including them.
@rasmus best to host your own no matter what as the community table file is huge and takes some time to parse.
@InfinityBlade so, does that mean it will be released this year?

@kevinmarks @bpm140 ah, found the pref, thanks. maybe i will use it for fun then.
@kevinmarks @bpm140 i understand the app. i just think that it is a shame that people are throwing away the real photo.
@bpm140 it isn't that i want you to have the original, it is that I want to have the original. instagram's camera app doesn't store it.
@bpm140 ah, i consider 600x600 sufficiently shitty that adding a filter isn't making it that much worse. :)

@jsjohnst 4.2.1 restore + sync should get you close. you'll likely be missing your email accounts. mobile me makes up the diff for me...
@jsjohnst restore isn't that much more than sync. i would tell you to reset settings if it would at least boot.
@jsjohnst you mean post sync or post restore? post restore can be tricky if there is an incompatible setting they didn't catch.

@abscondment @ryanspoon we've done some things with the API too.  Groupon as a platform has a long way to go re: attributes for targeting.
@abscondment @ryanspoon Sure.  Mashups are always possible.  It is less about that and more about iterating toward the future model of ads.

@johnmyleswhite @ChrisDiehl the purpose of healing yourself is not to just set a good example, it is to be able to actively help others.

@ChrisDiehl @johnmyleswhite suppose unchecked issues project on contact and actor a has issues.  Suppose a has contact with b.  What's next?
@ChrisDiehl @johnmyleswhite the way is to work on ourselves until we can become examples.  Without that, we can do no help for others.

@jamiebardin Yeah, it is confusing. And yet their public face is that they are dead. I don't get it.
@ivey I want to deploy the code to a bunch of new EC2 instances. Already made an image.
I feel this must be a solved problem, with examples, that has very poor SEO, right?
Anyone got a working example rake file or anything that boots EC2 machines, deploys a ruby project (NOT rails), starts a process? #in
@ivey It doesn't do EC2.  Why isn't there an out of the box EC2 solution for this?
Terrible pain/discomfort or intoxication is a crap choice to make every day. Ignoring the pain effects mood. Need to step up my Vipassana.

@niels_bom You're right. In this case I moved the same app from Redis to MySQL. However I was doing this because I *trust* MySQL. Tradeoffs.

How does leaking the fact that the King of Saud wants to attack Iran, stoking feuds, help humanity?
Journalists have long leaked secrets, but Journalism as religion served to filter leaks to serve the public good. This is something else.
@niels_bom Driving a boat is not easier than driving a car. Boats drift when not under throttle and steer from the back. Ever parked one? ;)

Putting data into MySQL is about 100 times as complicated in practice as putting it into a key/value store.
Can DataMapper do blobs? This is way too hard. #ruby
DataMapper in Sinatra with Amazon RDS is pretty painless. Easier than rolling your own MySQL certainly. MySQL is a fine key/value DB. #in

@meangrape @stevej I'd like is to have functionality like madvise() except for garbage collector (which like VM can be a leaky abstraction)

@MacDivaONA any chance you'll make it to the open data hackathon this weekend? A few of the usual suspects are going to the food + tech hack
@dhgisme we're a group of hackers that like to get dirty w/ data, if you can think of a project where we would be helpful please let us know
@mtanji email needs an opt-out option on messages with multiple recipients
@kevinweil that is what I am using now. Only advantage to GitBox seems to be the multiple repos
@johnmyleswhite @mikedewar @HarlanH I have an x-mas party that night, but will plan on being there all day, so I'll do the $5 version
Hard to imagine that WikiLeaks disclosures will lead to *less* over-classification http://bit.ly/fvamkN
@johnmyleswhite @mikedewar agreed, I need more @HarlanH in my life :) so are we signing up? http://foodhack.eventbrite.com/
@HarlanH @johnmyleswhite @mikedewar @dhgisme let's do it then! I'm an open gov pariah by now, so maybe they will welcome me ;)
@johnmyleswhite @mikedewar looks like we could also work on food stuff with @dhgisme, could be fun
@johnmyleswhite @mikedewar it is this Saturday, yes?  I am down, looks like we will be working with UN data http://bit.ly/gjRTmk
Is GitBox on OS X worth the $40?
@johnmyleswhite @mikedewar and scientists and journalists suffer the most
@johnmyleswhite @mikedewar for all of the light it has brought, in the end, it has set back open government efforts several years
@mikedewar would be interested in your take on it, since I know it is different than my own

Now more than ever, reading HN ends up reminding me to get back to work.
When you are near to see the the first things to work seriously it's hard to resist to code more, and possibly to trade code clearness ;)
it's a shame that if you code no stop for days you'll likely get sick, otherwise this is exactly my current desire with redis cluster.
Usually my programming style is exactly the contrary, bottom-up, but in the case of the cluster the "big picture" showed to be whole point.
Re TODO/FIXME in file, not a matter of bug tracking, I'm using this just to create the top-layer without fill details, to see it working
if I had 1000$ for every TODO and FIXME in the redis-cluster.c file... ;) Well actually it was a good idea to skip non-vital parts to start
it's cool the idea that redis-cli is such a fundamental component of redis, since it *actually* is :)
excited about @pnoordhuis adding completion to linenoise. This + a patch for redis-cli with help command + the connect thing I pushed today.
@pnoordhuis well in that case calloc made it traceable :)
@pnoordhuis fixed with a quick&dirty approach in master, I bet you'll want to fix it in a more proper way ;)
@pnoordhuis but that fd will be likely 0 or some other random number, and strange things will happen as I experimented the hard way ;)
@pnoordhuis: there is a bug in hiredis, REDIS_CONNECTED is set regardless of the actual connection. On error redisFree() will close the fd
my strange bug needed a strange explanation. I bet hiredis is closing the file descriptor 0 when freeing a context after an error...
stopping one moment with redis-cluster, I need "connect host port" in redis-cli to continue working in multiple instances comfortably

@rk There's absolutely no arguing who your father is in that photo, either. (cc @ieure)
@davekim We really need to get a ride in together sometime.
Heading to Denver today. Nobody ever mentions that those "Sunny and 50!" days end with lows in the mid-teens by 5PM.
@termie Have you tried the newer (Intel) ones? No issues with mine so far (~1 year old).
OH: "At some point I was definitely doing the splits."
@nzkoz Software RAID lets you mix and match as well. LVM on Linux and OS X's both have had that feature for years.
@keithelder Tell me about it. When do we call this a failed experiment?
Getting beat by 30 by OSU is not how you keep your U of M coaching job.
If one was looking at a Drobo, what else should one look at? Also, why not a Mini + software RAID + USB drives?
@JonathanBasker I'll be in Denver. :-/
@andybudd A common saying in the valley is that ideas are a dime a dozen, but execution is priceless. Execution matters.

Google Apps is increasingly unusable for me. Gmail has been slow for a while and now GCal is shitting itself.
@peterpham Haha! Not sure about that, but thanks. :)
@ieure It might be raining in SF, but at least it's 58F.
@mg Well, someday, you might get a girlfriend who wants to send you naughty pictures. My guess is you'll dump GV quickly when that happens.
@mg Google Voice doesn't support MMS yet either from what I understand. That's the only thing keeping me from using it full-time.

@tanepiper by immature I just mean that the libraries haven't been around for very long, so there's less documentation and likely more bugs

@intnorth I've added the videos to Lanyrd http://lanyrd.com/2010/interesting-north/video/
@CFWillSwain sorry about that, I'm afraid we have a bug when someone changes their Twitter username - I've fixed your Lanyrd account for you
@aexmo @markboulton oops, my mistake - I've fixed the URL and redirected the old one
@fivesimplesteps suggestion: create separate pages (hence separate URLs) for each of your workshops, to make them easier to talk about
@tjp sorry about that, I've refreshed your Lanyrd profile for you
@rsarver glad you like it - it's very much a joint project between myself and @natbat
In case you missed it last night (downside to launching at 2am GMT) Lanyrd now lists calls for speakers: http://lanyrd.com/blog/2010/calls/
@jdub maybe ;) wait and see
Posted Lanyrd's new call for proposals feature to Hacker News http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1936379
@rabble that was playdar
A woman just tracked us down in a coffee shop based on our tweets... and gave us a shopping bag full of crisps
@andybudd spamming people on Twitter is the new User Experience
Impressed by the ThinkVitamin 7 minute HTML5 &lt;canvas&gt; curves tutorial, very clearly explained http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWDvaUarCCc
@unwiredben that normally happens when our call to embed.ly times out - I'll think about adding a "try again" UI element somewhere
@cwebba1 BrandsConf is now on Lanyrd :) http://lanyrd.com/2010/brandsconf/

@danlevine I'll be at the SF Django meetup tonight :)
@philikon we're in town until the 29th. Thanks for the invitation! Not sure about plans for Friday yet, will know more by end of tomorrow
@russnelson we're in town for two weeks - leaving on 29th
@georginahardy we've prototyped that, but it won't be part of the live site for a while unfortunately - too much other stuff to do first!
@georginahardy we help you find events to attend, and we also collect slides/video/etc of the event afterwards, e.g. http://lanyrd.com/cwd
@DearMYRTLE I've deleted your profile from the site for you now - please let me know if there's anything else I can help you with
@DearMYRTLE our apologies - you're in the conference PDF http://j.mp/9waOg9 which must be why someone in our community added you to Lanyrd
@psvensson that was one of our original use cases for Lanyrd - we saw how hard it was to schedule an event without accidentally clashing
Arrived in San Francisco! Bit different from Egypt, not a single person has offered us a camel...
@helencurtis you need a Twitter account to sign in and edit pages, but you can still view conference listings or search the site without one

@lukask Lanyrd has many other uses like finding events to attend, catching up on videos, building a speaker profile of your talks /cc @m8nd1
@ketan our coverage feature doesn't ask you to upload stuff to us, you link to elsewhere and we embed widgets where available /cc @tommorris
@ripienaar hah, yes, the complaints about that are far more likely to come from people who understand the principle of least privilege!
@ripienaar definitely not just dev crowd, check out http://lanyrd.com/topics/criminology/ - if someone adds UKUUG stuff it'll be there :)
@garethr you can do topic + topic using our search engine: http://lanyrd.com/search/?show=all&topics=python,web-development
BarCamp London 8 is the first @natbat and I have missed :( Sounds like it's going great, nice to see so much stuff on http://lanyrd.com/cwd
@garethr I'd be quite surprised if you find a more comprehensive UK list than Lanyrd - which conferences do you know that are missing?
@garethr you seen http://lanyrd.com/topics/web-development/in/uk/ and http://lanyrd.com/topics/scaling/in/uk/ ? /cc @JayGreasley @StuRobson
@mariekeguy we're collecting slides / video / audio / notes on Lanyrd now with our new coverage feature http://lanyrd.com/blog/2010/coverage

@cnicolaou we're on the beach in Dahab, Egypt - Saudi Arabia is just visible through the haze across the Gulf of Aqaba
@bruntonspall tell them their web console doesn't let you select public AMIs at the moment, and it's driving me a bit nuts
@davecranwell I was fine with equalising, but I've never had much trouble with planes - take it really, really slowly I guess

@BlainSmith really sorry about that, I've fixed your Lanyrd account for you - we don't deal well with changed usernames at the moment!
@psychemedia @mhawksey we collect session start/end times but they're not entirely useful since we aren't timezone aware- coming soon though
@goetter I need to take a look at that, sorry :/ I think there's an API endpoint I can talk to, not sure how the UI would work though

@sunghu is that a palm pilot pro?
@meangrape also, software were ownership is often questioned (actors, coroutines, etc)make great candidates for automatic memory management.
@meangrape there needs to be better tooling for knowing how to tune your GC, I think.

It feels great to be back. To all my fans: Thank you. You are the reason this happened. Also, now I have to change my Twitter bio. Damn you.
Thanks to @YiyingLu, I can finally come clean about my terrible whale riding addiction: http://bit.ly/cbaajJ  #conanpalewhale  #conanreturns
I feel like I have something to do tonight that I keep forgetting.
Just tried on my suit for tomorrow’s premiere.  I have twelve hours to lose 35 pounds.
Tomorrow, I’ll be back where I truly belong - indoors, under artificial light.
48 hours until a show that will either blow up the paradigm of TV as we know it, or nestle comfortably among “Yes, Dear” reruns.
The next best thing to having a real blimp is having one made out of yarn: http://bit.ly/aOGU0v. Thanks, @craftyiscool.
Extremely hot in L.A. today. Just more proof of God’s plan to wipe out the California Irish.
Four days away from my new show. Tomorrow, I begin to prepare.
A lot of great candidates, and I just can’t make up my mind. Ok, fine. In-N-Out Burger. #dinner
Candy day is over, Turkey Day is coming up, and Egg Nog & Ham day is right around the corner…Why aren’t we all dead?

To be honest – so far my Rocktober has been more of a SmoothJazztober.
Last year for Halloween my daughter went as a witch.  This year, she’s going as Christine O’Donnell.
All of the Chilean miners have now been rescued. Geologists say the mine is now also a rich source of “man-stank”.

Watched “Boardwalk Empire” last night.  Needs more Snooki.
After 9 hours driving from drug store to drug store, it hit me: no one sells Columbus Day decorations.
The Nobel Prize in Science has gone to scientists who created an ultra-thin carbon. Actually it's normal thickness, but wearing stripes.
The White House announced it's switching to solar power. As a result, 20% of Americans now think Obama is an Apollo-worshipper.
The Chilean Miners could be released this weekend…  just in time to see Michael Bolton sing on DWTS. Guys, what’s an extra day?

Okay, I admit it. I find Meg Whitman’s ex-nanny weirdly attractive.
Rahm Emanuel has left the White House to run for Mayor of Chicago. Wow, and I thought I was the only one moving to a lower-paying job.
CNN’s Rick Sanchez said the Jews run CNN.  Ah, so that’s who we blame for Rick Sanchez.
The White House is proposing a way to spy on suspects while they're online. The plan is called "Signing them up for Facebook."
David Hasselhoff was kicked off of “Dancing With the Stars.” He should stick to singing. I mean acting. I mean…

Great game last night. Brett Favre fell on two loose balls and that was in the locker room.
I'm noticing that tweets with certain names and topics are more popular.  Bieber Gaga Kardashian breast. Glee.
Today I'm meeting @ev, the CEO and co-founder of Twitter. I bet he's going to invite me to get in on the ground floor of this whole thing.
Gaga just did a Vogue photoshoot wearing only raw meat. When she does it, it's art - when I do it, it's "Daddy, you ruined another BBQ."
It's the last weekend of summer, unless you live in LA, where it's the 198,789,960 weekend of summer. Chew on that, Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Craigslist has shut down their adult services section. Looks like the "used futon for sale" ads are about to get a lot more interesting.

@papierloos perhaps. I'm torn between trying to build something decentralized first, versus building great product and decentralizing later.

@sampullara Agreed. Identity is an enabler. We're still at the stage of helping people realize they ought have a choice in IDPs. /cc @atom
@raffi I am working on and advocating for identity in the browser every chance I get. ;) /cc @atom @sampullara
@atom exactly. The OIDF isn't the foundation that we joined two years ago. Perhaps it's not the right vehicle for folks like us anymore.
@atom I worry about OpenID without me (pragmatically speaking, of course) but I also worry about me with OpenID. Is it still worth my time?

@Gripnostril You don't think I should be invited to my own party? :)
@kb I can code in all three, but my Python is shit.  They think there's only one way to do it, but I always find a painful alternate route.
ooh, I have a shiny Kiwi Foo invite email in my inbox.  This damn thing might be ready to point and fire!
really fucking hating the lack of Perl's DWIM in Python.  For someone with as foul a mouth as me, I hate having to be explicit.

Being a great researcher, engineer, or business person has a lot to do with seeing what is important and focusing on it.
We are often either unable to see what is important to focus on, or undisciplined to focus on it if we do.
When you are ready for support, it shows up.  When you are ready to give, opportunity arises.
@ihat did u finally get a place to go do some real work? =)

@RKHilbertSpace i'll show you next year.
@daniel_levine Exactly.
@RKHilbertSpace Group buying is irrelevant.
@DaveKerpen Remember before Facebook, when we would have said that about Google because we couldn't see Facebook coming?
@RKHilbertSpace 1) brand. 2) there are special economics involved that most people are not understanding.
@DaveKerpen IMO, Facebook, Google, and Twitter are all strong companies but have weaker hands than people realize.
@daniel_levine Blackrock bought BGI.  Welcome to finance.
Google + Groupon won't figure out the iceberg under that tip.  The new model belongs with new products, and search isn't it.
Can't believe that Facebook and Twitter are letting Google get away with the Groupon deal.  Mistake.

@johnmyleswhite Are you coming out for the Strata conference? If so, it'd be great to connect in person.
@nealrichter No easy answer. Representation choices often drive deg of success. Good learning alg + bad representation = uncertain outcome
@bradfordcross Let's mix some social science w/ some machine learning & linear algebra and see what we get... :-)
@bradfordcross Regularized versions have been introduced. Some work was also done on quasiconvex losses that "give up" on tough examples.
@mdreid Forgot about that very definitive result...
@DataJunkie That's unfortunate. It's been accepted for a while that AdaBoost is not robust. Hence the drive toward other losses...
@DataJunkie With severe outliers, AdaBoost will place significant energy on those examples, never giving up.
@DataJunkie experiments were conducted on low noise datasets in UCI repository. Start adding label noise & things change. (2/2)
@DataJunkie Not sure about a proof but AdaBoost will certainly overfit. In early research, ppl believed it wouldn't because most (1/2)

@johnmyleswhite @mikedewar in theory, that is how the system works. Some information enters, and humans decide the classification

part of the complexity is dealing with unexpected things, like reconnecting after the link was down and discovering it's another guy :)
finally redis cluster is no longer a toy and starts to be hard to hack... tomorrow I'll complete the work started today and refactor it
Btw, we'll switch to public repository for Redis Cluster, that is, you'll have a playable alpha, for late January, promised! ;)
@m3thos sorry nowhere currently, lives in a private repository, for the time very big changes happen in hours or days.
coding a few rules so that it is unlike that two different redis clusters will join by autodiscovery for a networking error / IP changes
@hkarthik @agilejoe Redis is mainly developed in a 4GB MBP ;)
nodes auto discovery working great... that in turn makes simpler to hack to Redis Cluster as restarting an instance requires little work
Ok, let's open a discussion in the google group, that's going to be too important I guess.
I like more the one channel per DB approach honestly.
another issue is the different DBs identifier. Two approaches: publishing "id keyname" inside a single channel, or having a channel for DB
I mean, a key with an expire set can be destroyed by: expire, or DEL, SET, ... I think as a first step just natural expires should go in.
just branched to provide a master branch publishing all the expires into a channel. In your use case you want just natural expires, or dels?
@alextkachman yes we decided to add this at some point, not sure if it will be added for 2.2, but will be added.
2.2 is near. Possibly I'll merge BRPOPLPUSH, and will hack a few commands implementation for copy on write. And then it's time for RC1
@timhaines that is, to make some commands more sensible about copy-on-write. This will make us touching some code, but after that -&gt; RC1
@timhaines just for a FreeBSD specific issue actually. I think 2.2 is mostly production ready, even if we need to do a major change soon
Redis master was just tagged as 2.2-alpha6. This is what to use to experiment with it til new communication ;)
Now redis-cli in master supports inline help and completion of commands. Thanks to @tjholowaychuk and @pnoordhuis for this awesome work.
@pnoordhuis added your copyright notice in linenoise after merging, I think we should do this in Redis too...
@jzawodn @pnoordhuis hehe yep it really was the only important missing thing :) Just merged in linenoise.
Awesome! @pnoordhuis added completion to linenoise: http://bit.ly/eZhSQi and also integrated it in redis-cli. It's going to be merged today
@Delicious I will. the new not-quite-modal on-page popups are pretty nice, btw!

@Delicious I'm talking about the bookmarklet, which did auto-close before ...
@Delicious can I get the old one back? the new one is rather annoying in at least two ways: small notes field, click button to close (!)
@ihodes AFAIK it's stable on the BSDs & available as an opensource project on the mac.  I can't comment on the mac side yet.

@jrlevine @alexmr for a few months, I was actually downloading as many tweets as I could to a local hadoop cluster. I'm up to nearly 800M.
@jrlevine @alexmr streaming API.  I do quite a bit with twitter data. I'm more of a back-end dev but just started messing with app engine.
@jrlevine the twitter API rate limits and I are the worst of enemies.
@jrlevine ahhh...I thought all of the APIs are rate-limited - if you don't authenticate then I thought it limits by IP.  Interesting.
@jrlevine how are you managing to stay within the boundaries of the twitter api rate limits?  Was your app whitelisted?

@michaelhewett they slow down the page (seems iffy) and they're ugly/visually loud (I agree). Also some general twitter/facebook antagonism.
For background, most pro-button arguments were about traffic (I don't have ads & don't care) and I don't mind a barrier to mindless sharing.
Okay, I think it's settled; I'm still not adding tweet/Facebook buttons. Only button I have is Instapaper's Read Later. Thanks everybody!

@jimwebber interesting... but in this case is impossible. client not aware of the 3rd party (which also can change over time, twice lately)
@Codeness doing that, but unrelated. Sometimes u just don't have the 3rd serv data and you want to diff b/ your failure & 3rd party error
@stilkov fantastic... I was thinking about 502/504 as the only ways (plus passing back more details in the entity)
@Codeness not possible... it is critical to the result. Basically the "quality" of the response without 3rd party would go from 100% -&gt; 10%

@asenchi Someone should create Mechanical Turk for lawyers.
@asenchi Oh? How so? (Just curious)
@asenchi I think all we've done is confuse ourselves more. :-D I believe, at worst, I'm on legal gray ground coming after the fact.
@asenchi The wording mentions intent, conspire, reason to believe cause of injury. That covers the initial thef+leak and not subsequent use.
@asenchi That text only covers the stealing and initial distribution. Says nothing of subsequent uses. I agree stealing/1st dump is illegal.
@asenchi I think we're in the clear as it's generally available and not copyrighted. Let me know if you find anything.
@asenchi They're in possession of it, which you're implying is illegal. The leaking is illegal, but I don't believe possessing it is.
@asenchi Are you saying that the NYT and other news agencies are committing criminal acts? Too much precedence that it's not illegal data.
@asenchi I don't believe it's illegal data post-leak. The act of leaking it is illegal, but it's tax payer property.
@chaseswindler Appears they shut off access to their account. @TechCrunch has more coverage.
