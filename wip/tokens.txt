@neil_conway
that's
a
fascinating
analogy
not
sure
what's
equivalent
but
it
feels
right
that
schemas
ought
to
be
continuously
learned
@rjurney
@fdaapproved
agree
w
model
analogy
all
schemas
are
wrong
some
schemas
are
useful
yet
models
are
shorter
lived
than
schemas

@dnene
alas
twitter

keep
the

you
like

eventually

ah
that

you

we
collect

on

and
try
to
have
the
full

for
every

which
means
polling
or
activity
streams
@jonmrich
my
understanding
is
that
they
pull
it
it
in

only
when
you
request
that

it
happens

request
@jonmrich
nah
great

is
the
problem

the

@jonmrich
public
api
works
if
you
want
to
poll
for

not
when
you
have

it's
an
integration
challenge
@jonmrich
link
getstats
does
not
give
you

@cmastication

i
see

conjecture
that

by

his

all

it's
a

to
me
that

@interfluidity
they
have

yours
is
an
amazing
country
i
am
humbled
and
honored
by
my
time
here
alive
and
well
from
jaipur
rajasthan
india
so
much
to
tell
so
little
connectivity
that's
one
reason
i
don't
get
excited
about
most
opportunities
for
white
paper
business
if
i
did
everything
in
complete
paragraphs
rather
than
so
many
bullet
lists
it
would
be
even
harder
it's
amazing
how
much
fiddling
around
i
do
before
getting
to
the
point
where
i
know
ok
these
are
the
subjects
i
want
to
cover
was
wondering
what
to
blog
first
after
my
multi
week
hiatus
and
finally
settled
in
on
just
completing
the
last
post
s
i
was
working
on
by
murphy's
law
her
mail
that
went
astray
into
my
box
seemed
to
always
be
her
monthly
checks
from
daddy
well
there
was
the
time
a
distant
cousin
lived
in
my
apartment
building
and
had
the
mailbox
literally
next
to
mine
another
way
of

a

what
is
social

[post.ly]
@johnmyleswhite
that
deserves

i'll
put
something
up
this

@johnmyleswhite
other
examples
game
theory
decision

and
multi

systems
applied
to
social

@johnmyleswhite
somewhat
via

it's

@peterflom
such
a

using

@johnmyleswhite

not

can

@johnmyleswhite
that

if
you
publish
that
i've
noticed
similar
top

heavy
faculty
in
nearly
all
schools
lots
of
phds
@datajunkie
i
agree
but
what
makes
a
school
bad
is
a
state
school
with
a
lower
rank
bad
or
just
lower
ranked
just
pondering
out
loud

what
do
you
think
about
university
brands

do
smart

only
come

go

and
in

tucked
away
on

sidestreet
in
cholon
i
ordered
a
bottle
of
vietnamese
champagne
and
reached
in
my
pocket
then
tonight
i
took
her
as
a
surprise
to
the
banquet
hall
where
her
mom
and
dad
were
married
under
the
weight
of
the
war
in

and
so
today
i
brought
her
to
the
place
where
she
was
born
35
years
ago
and
to
the
temple
where
her
dad
prayed
for
her
as
a
newborn
...
when
we
find
someone
whose
weirdness
is
compatible
with
ours
we
join
up
with
them
and
fall
in
mutual
weirdness
and
call
it
love
our
days
since
have
been
replete
with
laughter
exploration
and
weirdness
we
are
all
a
little
weird
and
life's
a
little
weird
and
...
finally
fifteen
years
after
i
first
laid
eyes
on
her
she
asked
me
why
haven't
you
and
i
ever
dated
fifteen
years
carpe
diem
each
time
she
would
lovingly
turn
me
down
and
get
back
to
planning
an
adventure
for
us
invariably
we
would
end
up
laughing
our
asses
off
though
my
heart
sank
we
became
exactly
that
great
lasting
friends
though
i
asked
her
out
a
few
times
along
the
way
for
good
measure
during
the
first
week
of
our
freshman
year
i
saw
her
and
immediately
asked
her
out
she
laughed
and
said
we
should
just
be
friends

feedback
system
here

difficult
to
know
with

terms
@swardley
but
my
perception
is
1
the
internets
came
along
and
reduced
barriers
then
2
media
got
commoditized
@swardley
hmm
i
think
we're
arguing
in
a
factless
vacuum
ill
suited
to
140

:)
@swardley
no
exactly
as
i
said
see
your
media
example
it
was
commoditized
due
to
reduced
barriers
to
entry
not
the
other
way
around
@swardley
reduced
barriers
of
entry
causes
commoditization
:)

i
think
this

not
enough
for

@masonoise
but
well
all
in
all
the
bottle
neck
is
the
cpu
for
this

to
be
really
a
fast
user
experience
especially
for
compiling
@masonoise
for
the
use
case
of
this
small

4gb

not
the

and
the

neither
as
it's
fast
the

is
not
super
fast
but
ok
:)
@anibalrojas
not
getting
this
but
seems
like
that
dropbox

not
carry

and
alike
...
@oscar_raig
the
overlap
is
small
the
two
systems
are
mostly
used
for
different
use
cases
@dima767
@flangy
yep
probably
most
of
the
time
is
due
to
the
fact
it
depends
on
boost
but
you
can
compile
it
form
the
tar
gz
without
it
@flangy
ok
:)
but
actually
it
at
the
end
works
well
that's
a
good
point

no

@zrail
yep

@zrail

so
i

but
as
i
got
it
for

i
picked
the

today
i

tomorrow
i'll
ping

looking

there
is
some

what

was

with

solved
fyi
in

my

there
are
two

just

both

about

@pedromelo
@f
thank
you
for
all
guys
:)
i
really
enjoyed
my
time
with
you
and
your
friends
ah
and
all
the
wine
reached
sicily
safe
;)
major
outrage
at
@github
and
everybody
saying
good
things
about
it
proof
that
doing
a
lot
of
things
well
makes
rare
problems
ok
deserved
@_km
yes
that's
one
of
the
best
places
for
sure
:)
maybe
it's
the
other
way
around
as
well
as
people
from
north
may
feel
the
coffee
made
in
the
south
as
too
burned
or
alike
there
is
this
general
idea
of
italian
coffee
",
but
for
instance
when
i'm
at
north
italy
i
refuse
to
order
a
coffee
at
all
most
of
the
times
@paulogaspar7
being
into
gastronomic
tourism
is
a
great
idea
i
think
;)
btw
coffee
varies
a
lot
between
parts
of
italy
itself
@jonasl
glad
to
know
everything
is
working
fine
it's
one
of
the
best
moments
in
the
development
cycle
i
guess
;)
finally
at
home
long
trip
but
everything
fine
...
codebit
was
an
awesome
experience
and
i
meet
a
number
of
great
guys
see
you
soon
thx
@roidrage
i
think
the
latter
as
ways
less
deterministic
still
in
rome
but
leaving
for
sicily
in
minutes
...
i'll
miss
lisbon
but
wine
i'm
carry
with
me
will
alleviate
sadness
i
bet
leaved
the
hotel
will
be
traveling
for
the
whole
day
to
reach
home
but
it
was
definitely
worth
it
yes
not
only
valgrind
now
runs
on
snow
leopard
but
finally
it's
possible
to
suppress
the
possibly
lost
warnings
@paulogaspar7
absolutely
:)
so
far
the
first
that's
ok
in
eu
if
you
go
in
random
places
of
course
in
the
right
places
is
good
everywhere
it
looks
like
i
found
something
solving
the
key
iterator
and
the
cluster
get
key
in
hashslot
at
once
but
this
means
no
key
iterator

@janl
yep
but
only
if
done

i
hope
i'll
try
to

there
to

how
multiple

is
the
way
to
go
and
that
i
like
sql
@roidrage
it
is
a

you
are
not

:)
just

it's

@pedromelo

the

you
@nvie
@pedromelo

ok

@mrjaba
i
use

i've
to

it
a
bit
but
it's
a

i
guess
:)
i

it's

overhead

@yoniboy
btw
if
anything
i'm
trying
to
argue
against
collecting
brands
through
your
career
not
for
it
...
@yoniboy
a
brand
does
help
as
a
filter

i
have
plenty
of
investments
for
example
in
people
with
no

@sergekass
true

@portman_wills
ivy

of

1

if

more
than
one
means
you

@j2labs
fair
point
i'm
not
saying
brands
don't
matter
but
once
you
have
1
or
2
under
your
belt
it's
time
to
stop
collecting
them
huge
hurdle
for
many
people
joining

is
their
confidence
is
closely
tied

big

famous
college
company
etc
@daveedgr
@cchiego
but
no
single
definition
will
satisfy
everyone
@daveedgr
@cchiego
indeed
though
one
could
argue
that
in
the
kkk's
case
the
terrorism
was
most
acute
in
the
face
of
desegregation
@cchiego
@daveedgr
my
argument
is
that
traditional
criminality
does
not
destabilize
institutions
nor
is
it
intended
to
@daveedgr
@cchiego
perhaps
terrorism
is
best
defined
as
acts
intended
to
destabilize
civilian
institutions
formal
or
informal
)?
@daveedgr
@cchiego
but
if
terrorism
is
def'n
by
political
coercion
than
how
can
shabaab
be
terrorists
if
there
is
no
state
to
coerce
@daveedgr
@cchiego
but
if
terrorism
is
def'n
by
political
coercion
than
how
can
shabaab
be
acting
as
terrorism
if
there
is
no
@cchiego
@daveedgr
interesting
point
as
there
is
an
implicit
assumption
of
state
capacity
for
terrorism
to
be
def'n
as
political
coercion
@daveedgr
correct
that
is
a
more
accurate
way
to
put
it
@joshuafoust
i
always
found
that
advice
to
be
useful
when
i
lived
in
dc
@daveedgr
i
find
a
majority
of
so
called
terrorism
cases
more
rightfully
classifieds
as
traditional
law
enforcement
incidents
@daveedgr
i
find
the

useful

well

just
the
vga
cable
included
had
to
purchase
one
separately
to
fully
exploit
it
@dvirsky
yep
unfortunately
i
arrived
at
the
shop
very
late
and
the
magazine
was
closed
so
i
had
to
pick
the
22
or
return
again
-&
gt
22
:)
got
a
22
monitor
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
actually
an
improvement
compared
to
the
13
display
especially
for
two
terminals
at
once
@davidnwelton
absolutely
you
have
to
resist
till
aug
2011
but
it's
simpler
to
resist
in
summertime
;)
@demisbellot
yep
married
august
2011
:)
the
goal
is
making
n
children
@f
yep
:)
one
of
the
things
i
could
like
to
write
is
a
closed
p2p
network
just
for
friends
something
like
up
to
100
trusted
guys
@_km
apart
from
redis
iter
matter
i
think
c
code
when
well
written
tends
to
be
very
reliable
because
of
the
static
checks
@seivanheidari
redis
cluster
command
line
utility
no
external
dependencies
system
software
in
c
feels
more
reliable
redis
cli
already
has
history
and
line
editing
we'll
just
extend
it
decision
taken
with
the
help
of
the
community
on
irc
redis
trib
will
be
written
in
c
as
well
reasons
in
the
next
tweet
@demisbellot
good
points
maybe
after
all
we'll
see
it
works
well
in
ruby
and
can
avoid
porting
it
there
are
much
more
ruby
hackers
than
c
a
possible
plan
could
be
starting
the
prototype
in
ruby
and
turning
it
into
c
code
after
it
is
working
well
actually
my
main
concern
is
that
the
c
version
would
build
together
with
redis
in
a
zero
dependencies
environment
...
here
i
need
some
honest
feedback
what
do
you
think
about
implementing
redis
trib
in
ruby
instead
of
c
it
does
not
need
to
be
fast
@railshoster
very
glad
you
are
happy
with
redis
please
send
me
tweets
if
something
is
not
working
properly
plan
of
the
afternoon
cluster
auto
discovery
processing
the
gossip
session
to
minimize
the
number
of
cluster
meet
commands
needed
survived
another
dentist
session
...
not
bad
next
one
in
a
few
days
but
prevention
is
much
better
than
pain
@sloser
looks
great
:)
thanks
@dscape
no
plan
to
support
full
text
search
so
far
for
redis
cluster
you
can
build
it
by
hand
if
you
wish
we
try
exporting
primitives
i
think
i
was
not
clear
about
french
tweets
redis
is
a
french
word
meaning
to
say
again
similar
to
italian
ridire
").
i
need
a
way
to
read
the
redis
search
twitter
stream
but
filtering
the
messages
in
french
language
...
i
guess
i'll
have
to
write
a
script
@sloser
did
you
tried
redis
tools
@riffraff
what
part
of
regexps
is
not
ugly
;)
as
far
as
it
works
well
it's
very
clean
hehe
good
cluster
progresses
in
the
morning
now
trying
to
learn
cachegrind
to
understand
were
we
can
gain
cycles
before
of
cache
misses
@jdrowell
thanks
for
the
hint
spawning
n
nodes
in
different
ports
and
reconnecting
them
at
every
recompilation
of
redis
cluster
is
time
consuming
i
need
more
automation
@riffraff
something
along
the
lines
n
,}
current
solution
we
clear
the
ip
port
field
from
the
node
info
and
wait
for
a
gossip
that
will
tell
use
the
new
address
to
reconnect
current
status
trying
to
figure
what
to
do
when
after
a
node
-&
gt
node
reconnection
we
discover
it
is
no
longer
the
same
guy
@mikeloukides
in
some
place
inside
:)
to
avoid
customers
thinking
there
is
an
info
point
hehe
i
love
the
new
valgrind
option
--
show
possibly
lost
no
if
you
remember
i
tweeted
about
how
painful
was
to
work
without
it
many
times
@seivanheidari
the
book
will
take
longer
than
this
;)
not
sure
about
the
release
date
currently
but
we
are
writing
@dscape
[redis.io]
@anibalrojas
haha
good
point
;)
@julien51
alpha
in
two
months
beta
in
four
months
first
production
version
possibly
in
6
months
@travellperkins
never
used
so
what
i
can
say
about
riak
is
just
that
the
basho
guys
are
nice
in
my
opinion
i
should
ask
vmware
to
send

@ezmobius
nothing
is
as
cool
as
writing
an
interpreter
in
programming
@slig
thanks
for
the
link
but
after
all
configured
everything
in
no
time
with
gitolite
...
and
it's
working
great
@emaaaa
gitolite
@laktek
no
web
interface
needs
so
far
just
plain
ssh
and
the
minimal
scripts
needed
to
configure
new
repositories
@pedromelo
@f
that's
the
hint
i
needed
:)
thanks
@mxey_
because
private
repositories
are
costly
if
you
add
a
private
repo
for
any
small
thing
you
do
setting
up
my
mini
github
in
a
super
small
linode
instance
so
that
i
can
put
everything
on
git
and
use
github
only
for
serious
stuff
@seppo0010
not
sure
yet
...
still
to
define
@tshanky
thank
you
:)
@aschmitz
i
think
we'll
add
a
last
time
chapter
about
it
if
we
have
already
an
alpha
version
@tshanky
still
not
sure
...
it
is
not
impossible
to
have
it
publicly
available
but
i've
no
details
not
sure
yet
about
this
@tshanky
there
are
really
no
rules
and
indeed
bigger
books
have
their
space
for
sure
we
just
are
trying
to
put
the
maximum
amount
of
signal
@tshanky
we
think
that
275
pages
is
more
or
less
the
maximum
detail
level
every
language
db
book
should
reach
:)
it's
an
auto
limit
@derekcollison
i
wish
you
a
good
flight
:)
@debasishg
yes
makes
sense
for
sure
the
whole
book
will
be
full
of
advices
about
what
is
not
sensible
to
do
with
it
@tshanky
well
it
tries
to
cover
everything
more
or
less
but
not
using
too
much
space
the
title
is
still
uncertain
@ivanristic
it's
in
asciidoc
@roidrage
lol
:)
this
is
how
the
redis
book
will
likely
be

i'll

@keltounet

a

thank
you

even
if

you
did
a

that

my

just
found
out
today
that
the

a

he
pulls

@tanepiper
by

that

that

questions
for
vcs
and
angels
[measuringmeasures.com]
being
a
great
researcher
engineer
or
business
person
has
a
lot
to
do
with
seeing
what
is
important
and
focusing
on
it
we
are
often
either
unable
to
see
what
is
important
to
focus
on
or
undisciplined
to
focus
on
it
if
we
do
when
you
are
ready
for
support
it
shows
up
when
you
are
ready
to
give
opportunity
arises

@rkhilbertspace

@daniel_levine
exactly
@rkhilbertspace
group
buying
is
irrelevant
@davekerpen
remember
before
facebook
when
we
would
have
said
that
about
google
because
we
couldn't
see
facebook
coming
@rkhilbertspace
1
brand
2
there
are
special
economics
involved
that
most
people
are
not
understanding
@davekerpen
imo
facebook
google
and
twitter
are
all
strong
companies
but
have
weaker
hands
than
people
realize
@daniel_levine

welcome

google
groupon
won't
figure
out
the
iceberg
under
that
tip
the
new
model
belongs
with
new
products
and
search
isn't
it
can't
believe
that
facebook
and
twitter
are
letting
google
get
away
with
the
groupon
deal
mistake
@chrisdiehl
can't
wait
to
take
convex
optimization
...
but
one
step
at

@chrisdiehl
i'll

more
to
say
in

a
year
but
if
you
want
to
talk
about
linear
algebra
i
can
do
that
now

a

we'll

happen

that

@hkarthik
@agilejoe
redis
is
mainly
developed
in

;)
nodes
auto
discovery
working
great
...
that
in
turn
makes
simpler
to
hack
to
redis
cluster
as
restarting
an
instance
requires
little
work
ok
let's
open
a
discussion
in
the
google
group
that's
going
to
be
too
important
i
guess
i
like
more
the
one
channel
per
db
approach
honestly
another
issue
is
the
different
dbs
identifier
two
approaches
publishing
id
keyname
inside
a
single
channel
or
having
a
channel
for
db
i
mean
a
key
with
an
expire
set
can
be
destroyed
by
expire
or
del
set
...
i
think
as
a
first
step
just
natural
expires
should
go
in
just
branched
to
provide
a
master
branch
publishing
all
the
expires
into
a
channel
in
your
use
case
you
want
just
natural
expires
or

@alextkachman

will

2

possibly
i'll

and
will
hack
a

implementation
for
copy
on

and
then
it's
time
for
rc1
@timhaines
that
is
to
make
some
commands
more
sensible
about
copy
on
write
this
will
make
us
touching
some
code
but
after
that

rc1
@timhaines
just
for

actually
i

is

production
ready
even
if
we
need
to
do
a
major
change
soon

master
was
just
tagged

@gfilicetti
that's
a

just
settled
on

it
was
the
only
tool
i
knew
anybody
was
using
on
my
site
@jguns
@djacobs

@tangentialism

sf
@gavinpurcell
i
don't
think
the
redesign
is
solely
to
support
dayparting
c
f
[2.dashes.com]
but
i'm
sure
it
was
a
factor
@gavinpurcell
that
definitely
works
all
the
gawker
sites
for
example
do
exactly
that
for
a

i
really
believed
@dens

@3rdwavelands
this
campaign
to
get

to
quit
using

exists
only
in

@3rdwavelands
i
sincerely
don't
know

the

you're

@dan_munz

like

write

what
they
retweet
or
you
know
inspiring
blog
posts
comments
@michaelhewett
they
slow
down
the
page
seems
iffy
and
they're
ugly
visually
loud
i
agree
).
also
some
general
twitter
facebook
antagonism
for
background
most
pro
button
arguments
were
about
traffic
i
don't
have
ads
don't
care
and
i
don't
mind
a
barrier
to
mindless
sharing
okay
i
think
it's
settled
i'm
still
not
adding
tweet
facebook
buttons
only
button
i
have
is
instapaper's
read
later
thanks
everybody
@marcslove

@gruber
i
did

so
until

easy
@torrez
@mathowie
talk
to
@rsarver
tell
the

you
need
transclusion
really
interesting
half
of
you
say
slow
buttons
design
clutter
are
a
bad
experience
half
say
difficult
sharing
is
a
bad
experience
hmm
okay
so
a
few
people
asked
for
tweet
buttons
on
my
blog
posts
anybody
want
to
argue
against
me
adding
twitter
or
facebook
buttons
@james_gross
yeah
i
am
good
at
breaking
my
blog
:)
it's
fixed
now
@rsarver
first
request
i've
had
for
one
get
more
people
to
ask
for
it
so
i
can
overcome
my
laziness

says
nothing

i
agree
stealing

you
find
anything
@asenchi
they're

which
you're

is

the
leaking
is
illegal

i
don't

@isterin
i
think
we'll
agree
to
disagree
i
think
these
leaks
if
handled
properly
which
this
one
has
been
are
a
good
thing
@isterin
your
statement
of
what
next
all
names
of
foreign
operatives
@al3xandru
[madeatgloria.com]
@isterin
and
your
response
very
much
was
reactionary
in
the
same
way
the
right
responds
to
gay
rights
in
the
what
next
?!
sense
@isterin
your
missing
his
point
that
any
leak
of
truth
being
called
treasonous
is
a
slipper
slope
i
agree
with
that
message
@isterin
way
to
completely
miss
the
heart
of
the
message
yes
let's
do
all
of
that
while
we're
at
it
let's

i
said
that

we

an

@jeremycloud
